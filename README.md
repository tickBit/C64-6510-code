# C64 6510 code

- Circle-sprites.asm.
    8 sprites in a bit flattened circle..
    Back in the day I've done sprite programming on Commodore 64 in basic only. This is my first attempt ever to do some sprite programming in 6510 assembly. The code can be compiled at least with 64tass cross assembler.

- Rastercolors.asm.
    Some raster color bars and text scrolling.

The both programs can be started by typing "sys 49152" in basic..

Below are pictures of the two programs mentioned above:

## Some more info

I'm planning to put in this repo some C64's 6510 codes..
